The purpose of this project is to index the Civilization 2 user's guide and to provide a query function. Querying the
index returns a list of sentences ranked by their relevance to the given query.

Run the run.sh script to run this program which both indexes the user's guide and then queries it using each of the
query strings provided in the script. Running this script will reproduce the results discussed in our paper, writing
them to a log file.

For example:

$ ./run.sh
$ more query_results.log
